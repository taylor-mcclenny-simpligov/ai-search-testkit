# Benchmark Readme

This repo hosts a similarity benchmark for SGWs. Key pieces:
- Compressed SGWs (`.sgws`) generated from full SGWs (Miles’s converter).
- Gold-standard neighbor labels computed from the compressed corpus.
- Scripts to build the corpus, generate manifests, embed, and score pipeline runs.

See `benchmark-roadmap.md` for the full plan.
